# Maze-Solver:
  Assume you have an autonomous bot with 2 Arduino Uno. 1st Uno has 1 LCD Display to display direction,
  speed and controls 4 wheels using 4 motors controlled via motor driver. 2nd Uno has 3 ultrasonic sensor,
  and a maze solving algorithm deployed. 2nd Uno recieves information about obstacle distance and based 
  on it changes its path to solve the maze. 2nd Uno gives 4 digital and 1 analog output to 1st Uno.
  Deploying a maze solving algorithm and simulating this bot as we try to solve as much as scenarios we can 
  think of.
